# 👨‍💻 Ajay's DevOps Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository!  
I'm diving deep into the world of **DevOps**—learning the tools, practices, and mindset that bridge the gap between development and operations. This repo is my open notebook where I’ll track everything I learn, build mini-projects, and share insights.

## 📌 Why DevOps?

DevOps brings together **development**, **operations**, and **automation** to deliver software faster and more reliably. As a future-ready engineer, I’m passionate about learning tools that enable **CI/CD**, **containerization**, **orchestration**, and **cloud-native** deployments.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- 📁 **Linux & Shell Scripting**
- 🔄 **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)
- ⚙️ **CI/CD** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- 🐳 **Docker** (Containers)
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** (Container Orchestration)
- 🌍 **Terraform & Ansible** (Infrastructure as Code)
- 📊 **Monitoring** (Prometheus, Grafana)
